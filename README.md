## Features
- **Basic Game Physics**: The bird falls due to gravity and can jump with the space bar.
- **Procedurally Generated Obstacles**: Pipes appear at intervals with randomized gaps for the bird to navigate through.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the score based on how many pipes the bird successfully passes.
- **Game Over and Restart**: The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground, and can be restarted.
