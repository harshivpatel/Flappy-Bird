# Flappy-Bird
This is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game built using Java and Swing. The game features basic mechanics such as the bird's movement controlled by spacebar, randomly generated pipes that the player needs to avoid, and a scoring system based on the number of pipes passed.
